hey, this is one of mjnt's pointless mods that counts the total coins that the goblins you have killed drops.

commands are:
/rc (resets coin counter)
/td (toggles goblin display)
/setpos [x] [y] (customize where the gui is on your screen)

other than that, it should be good. just stick it in your mods folder and ur good to go!
